# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are listed down into what we call user stories at least in a agile approach. The user stories are small objectives the agile team will plan to finish during a sprint in order to deliver them to the end user and since we are in a agile approach we will always have a runnable program at the end of each sprint. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When approaching a program I will think of ways we can break it down into easy to read and follow guidelines so when we are developing the program we know what has to be done and what is left. The agile processes I hope to incorporate are things like the user stories and adding priority levels to them, this will allow flexibility if any changes occur along the way and allow me to quickly adapt. I would also like to add the sprint review and retrospective is a good behavior to do as I will be able to hone my skills and improve myself where I see my faults.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

This is a good question because with the growing use of an agile-approach, which is team oriented it is important to have a good relationship with your teammates. I think in order to have this relationship we should be able to listen to the issues one may have and help when we can.
